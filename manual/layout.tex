\chapter{Customizing lay-out}

\section{Changing style sheet}
A large part of the lay-out of the HTML files generated by \oxdoc~is controlled by its
style sheet, {\tt oxdoc.css}. \oxdoc~creates a default
lay-out file if it is not present, but it won't overwrite changes you make
to that file. The {\tt css/} directory of your \oxdoc~installation contains a number of 
standard style sheet files. To choose any of them, just replace the {\tt oxdoc.css} file
by any of the files from that directory.
